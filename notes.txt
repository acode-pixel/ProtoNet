TODO:
	create client module (handles broadcasting/re-broadcasting messages through the network, client side functions)
	create server modue (handles serving files and general sendig of files)
	create core (see notes for functions)

notes:
	how transfering files work:
		client -> network : broadcasts a requested known file from the network
		network : other connected clients re-broadcasts the message to other clients
		network -> server : Server module detects a request from the network that has the available file
		server -> network : Server tries to retrace the path of the original request through the network to give transaction ID (computers between the path log the transaction ID for further use)
		network -> client : Client receives a transaction ID for file sharing.
		client -> network -> server : bothe client and server now have a route in which data can be sent and received from one another (with the help of transaction IDs to guide the data)
		server -> network -> client : server sends an EOF message to the client through the server
		client -> network -> server : client sneds a request to destroy the path to the server
		server -> network -> client : server agrees	
		server & client : both server, network, and client delete their transaction ID removing the path of transmission
		END OF OPERATION

	core:
		handles and manages transaction IDs that a computer has
